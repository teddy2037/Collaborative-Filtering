# DataMiningP3
## How to run our code:
The files in the folder are the result of Project 3: Collaborative Filtering, part of the 5 project series in ECE 219: Large-Scale Data Mining. The code repo contains \*.py files that contain functionality of 1 or more than 1 question from the spec. The names of the files are self-explanatory. This project has been developed by Ravi Teja, Pavan Holur, Donna Branchevsky and Megan Williams | Winter 2019

*To run the code, please verify that the MOVIELENS data folder is downloaded into the working directory of the project.*
In terminal the individual functions may be run as:
>> python Project3_*.py

The files use neighboring files to include pre-written packages. Please do not move subfiles to another directory.

## To install missing packages:
Install pip and then perform
>> pip install <package>

Tested on Python 2; should run on Python 3 as well with print exceptions.
